Professional Pitch: Hi there! I'm Kristian Dotson, a student at CodeCrew aspiring to be a Software Developer.

I've gained work experience through a summer program and building a website with a classmate. I've also honed my teamwork skills through team-building workshops with individuals from diverse backgrounds.
